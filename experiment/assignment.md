#### Pre-Experiment

- What are the advantages of using fluorescein molecule for pH-dependent fluorescence studies?
- What kind of electronic transition is responsible for fluorescence in fluorescein molecule?
- Which proton is lost last from the fluorescein molecule when fluorescein reacts with NaOH?
- Methanolic solution of fluorescein is acidic, pH= 4. How can you explain this?

#### Post-Experiment

- Out of two carboxylic acid forms, which form of fluorescein molecule fluoresces most intensely?
- Which molecular form of fluorescein molecule requires more energy for electronic transition?
- Why did the shoulder peaks appear in the excitation and emission spectra when NaOH was not added?
- How do the Stokes shifts vary depending on the pH of the solution?
